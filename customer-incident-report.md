# Customer Incident Report
{: #cir}

IBM Cloud works hard to maintain high availability of our infrastructure and cloud services, however sometimes customers experience an impact to their service. We realize that when this happens, you need to understand what happened, how services were impacted, and what we are doing to make sure the impacting event does not reoccur. 

## Getting the information you need following an impacting event 
{: #cir-customerinfo}

Reporting an impacting event begins with the creation of a support case. After the case is opened you will work with a dedicated team of Advanced Customer Support (ACS) specialists who can help resolve many issues. If the scope of an impacting event is isolated to your local environment, then this team can also answer your questions and provide you with the information you require as to the root cause, steps to mitigate, and any future actions you and/or IBM Cloud can take to prevent similar events from impacting service delivery and consumption in the future. If the scope of an impacting event is of a larger enterprise wide scope, then ACS will update your case informing you of this Customer Impacting Event (CIE). If you require a formal response to this enterprise event, you can request in the case that you be provided with a Customer Incident Report (CIR) for this issue. 

IBM Cloud requires that all enterprise level CIEs include a thorough Root Cause Analysis. The CIR is a summary of the findings of this investigation. After ACS receives your request for a CIR, they will verify that your specific issue was indeed caused by this CIE, and if so, a request will be made to develop a CIR. When received, the responsible team who owns the root causing issue will work to provide the CIR within our Service Level Objective (SLO) of five-business days. Please keep in mind that sometimes the Root Cause Analysis investigations can be complex and involve product specialists, program review, vendor discussion, and so forth, can vary. In cases where it will take longer for a final CIR document to be delivered, we will attempt to provide you with an ‘Interim CIR’ within the five-business day SLO. This interim document will tell you what we know at this point, and whatour current investigative steps are, and will let you know when you can expect the next update. Depending on the complexity of the incident, it might require more than one interim CIR before the final version is published.

After the CIR document is prepared, it will be attached to your case as a PDF for you to download.
