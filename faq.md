## How do I escalate support cases? 
{: #escalate_support}
{: faq}

As an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} customer, you can escalate support cases to surface critical issues. After a case is escalated, the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support team reviews the information and responds with updates. For information about case severity, see [Case severity and initial response times](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-case-severity).

To escalate a support case, complete the following steps: 
1. Contact {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Support by phone or chat:
  * By phone at the following number: +1-866-403-7638.

1. Provide your existing case number and a request to escalate the case. 
1. Provide a justification for the escalation and explain the business impact of your problem or issue. 

If your support inquiry requires a more immediate response, consider upgrading to the premium or advanced support plan so that you can open severity 1-4 support cases. To upgrade your support plan, contact your [IBM sales representative](https://www.ibm.com/contact/us/en/?lnk=flg-cont-usen){: external}.

## How am I charged for support? 
{: #support-costs}
{: faq}

If you have Advanced or Premium support, you can track your monthly support costs. In the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Manage** > **Billing and usage**, and select **Support costs**. Each support plan has a minimum monthly support price for your cloud workload at the stated service level. Beyond this starting price, any additional costs for support are based on your resource usage. The higher your resource usage, the higher your total support cost. 

To view your support costs, you need an access policy with the Administrator role on the Billing account management service. For more information about access roles, see [IAM access](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles).


## How can I upgrade my support plan? 
{: #support-plan}

If you want to upgrade your support plan, contact your [IBM sales representative](https://www.ibm.com/contact){: external}. For more information on the different support plans, see [Basic, Advanced, and Premium Support plans](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-support-plans).


## Why can't I see my support cases? 
{: #view-support-cases}
{: faq}

To access your support cases, in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, go to **Support** > **Manage cases**. If you're unable to view your cases, try clicking **View classic infrastructure cases**. 

If you still can't view them, you might not have the required permission. Ask your account owner to add you to the support case access group. For more information, see [SoftLayer account permissions](/docs/account?topic=account-migrated_permissions).
